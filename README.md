# NFA-to-DFA

In this project ,first we get a file that contains a number of states, symbols, number of
 accepting states and then transition function which showes the movement between states.

we give the transition function as a matrix.
for instance:

  0   a   0...
  
  c   0   0...
  
  0   0   b...
